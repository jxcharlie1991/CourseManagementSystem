# CourseManagementSystem
This project is a websit project which is implemented in PHP. It has implemented all the functions of a real Course Management System.
The file "localhost.sql" is my database, before uploading the website to server, you should import the file into your database.

Disadvantages of this website:
It cannot show the consultation timetable (although UC and DC can allocate the consultation time), it cannot allocate a UC and DC, and so on.
Another shortage is that I was not a programmer before, so I do not know the preference that other programmers have. For example, I just use words “enrolled”, “enrol”, “choose” and “success” on the button, because I don’t know what should be written on the button.
Another problem is the choice of Synchronou and Asynchronous, almost every page need to communicate with database, so there is a choice of Synchronou and Asynchronous. In this project, I prefer to display my my skills and logic, so I use Asynchronous more than Synchronou.

Note:
Please follow the rule when set IDs, it must be 6 numbers, unit code uses three letters and three numbers, because I didn’t limit the inputs in php, there are already too many limits in the website. 
All the accounts have allocated levels, lecturers or tutors, if you want to text the access level, you need to undo allocate in Master List Allocation, or register a new account.
In addition, I used bootstrap, jquery, ajax, jquery tabledit, bootstrap icons in the website, and I use several Internet pictures in the website, and other codes are all my own work.
